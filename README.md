# Weekly Challenge #3: React Single Responsibility Principle

Your task this week is straight forward. You've been provided a simple form built in React that logs the form data on submit.

HOWEVER, the dev in charge put the entire form in the `App.jsx` file! ðŸ˜±

Using [React's Single Responsibility Principle](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react), break this app down into components where it makes sense.

Make sure it still works once you do!

_Don't worry about the CSS, as long as you keep the class names the same it should be fine. Focus on React alone in this one._

## Task List

-   [ ] Fork this repository
-   [ ] Pull it down locally
-   [ ] Run `npm install`
-   [ ] Use `npm run dev` to run React on Vite
-   [ ] Review the `App.jsx` file and play with the form to see how it works
-   [ ] Break the form down into multiple components
-   [ ] Test the form to make sure it still works

## Stretch Goals

-   [ ] Create unit tests in Jest
-   [ ] Add TypeScript to the application
-   [ ] Replace the styles with a library like Bootstrap or Tailwind
-   [ ] Have the completed form send an email to yourself
-   [ ] Replace the form with a popular third party form like [React Hook Form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form)
-   [ ] Build additional components in a single file, then break them out into multiple files to continue practicing SOLID principles
